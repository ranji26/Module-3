## SEB - SWAPPING TWO TUPLES

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to accept two tuples from the user and swap their values.

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Accept two tuples from the user using eval() and store them in tuple1 and tuple2.
3. Swap the tuples using tuple unpacking: tuple1, tuple2 = tuple2, tuple1.
4. Print the values of tuple1 and tuple2 after the swap.
5. Terminate the program.


### PROGRAM

tuple1=eval(input()) <br>
tuple2=eval(input())  <br>
tuple1,tuple2=tuple2,tuple1 <br>
print(tuple1)  <br>
print(tuple2) <br>


### OUTPUT

### RESULT

Thus the Python program to swap the values of two tuples was executed successfully and verified.
